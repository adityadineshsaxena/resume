                <p>tl;dr</p>
                <p>This is my story, so far! I'll try to keep this short. You can move onto other sections if you'd like.</p>
                <p>With a knack for creativity in problem-solving, the field of Design was always an attractive choice for me for Graduate studies. I took up the Bachelor of Design course at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati where I majored in Communication Design with a strong focus on Usability and HCI.</p>

                <p>Three subsequent internships in the field of Print Media, 3D design and 3D web during my course helped me realize that my interests lay in providing thoughtful and seamless user experiences over the web. After graduation, I worked for 4 years as an <strong>Interaction Designer at D E Shaw India (Hyderabad)</strong> where I worked extensively on the company’s software products for desktop and web providing User Interface designs and Front-End deliverable for these products. Keeping abreast of latest web technologies and user-interface innovations helped me provide engaging design solutions which were efficient and easy to use by a varied workforce in the Company.</p>

                <p>I had the opportunity to debate my design thinking with users, stakeholders and business analysts alike and present my design solutions with appropriate reasoning, user research, user interaction pattern observations and TAP (Think-Aloud Protocol) testing.</p>

                <p>Having grasped the understanding and practical know-how behind crafting UX for any successful product, I was itching to get on with Creating end-to-end User Interfaces. I wanted the power to create stuff and my successful stints with jQuery/HTML/CSS landed me a job with <strong>Sprinklr - a Social Media Management product</strong>. It was a blessing in disguise - working with some of the most talented people I've been around and gaining expertise in the field of core Web Development. I had little idea how much I had gained from this stint. Working on the latest technologies in the field of UI Engineering, at Sprinklr, I truly began my journey towards bigger things in the Tech industry.</p>

                <p>After having spent a good year at Sprinklr, I was presented with possibly the best professional stint - and I didn't turn away - <strong>McKinsey & Co.</strong> In early 2013, I joined McKinsey Digital Labs (MDL) - the digital arm of McKinsey, and it has been an absolutely glorious journey till date. I have worked on International Client Engagements, with some of the best talents on the planet, and have never had an opportunity not to learn.</p>

                <p>Working within the MDL group has given me tremendous exposure to everything Web, made me capable of coming out all guns blazing in tricky client situations, and has made me a better person because of the McKinsey culture I can be proud of.</p>

                <p>I'd be delighted to know how better this journey could get. And, if there are better places to work than where I'm right now. Here's to hope!</p>
